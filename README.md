# PatentTools

## Summary
PatentTools is a collection of basic tools for fetching and interpreting patent information. It currently supports only US Patents.

Its basic input is a US Patent number. It provides bibliographic information about the patent (title, assignee, etc.). It also may be used to highlight sentences may be pulled from the claims and/or description sections; highlights are selected based on word frequencies. Finally, it can be used used to understand the broader significance of a patent in the context of the other patents that it cites through the generation of key two-word phrases (bigrams).

Please see the Jupyter Notebook example-use.ipynb for a demonstration of PatentTools' function.
