# PatentTools

## Summary
PatentTools is a web-based interface that allows you to quickly understand the key details of a patent. You provide a patent number, and PatentTools shares key metadata about it (such as the title and filing year) and also performs basic natural language processing to identify key concepts (as bigrams).
